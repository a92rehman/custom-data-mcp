# Rules Index

This file is auto-loaded every session. Read the relevant section based on the user's question.

## How This Works
- **Governance logic lives here** in `.claude/rules/` — not in Python code
- **MCP server is a thin execution layer** — use `execute_query`, `list_datasets`, `get_table_schema` tools
- **Rules are organized by region** — always determine the region first, then read that region's rules

## Step 1: Determine Region
Always clarify which region before reading domain rules:
- `organization_id = 1` → **ICT/Islamabad** → read `ict-islamabad/`
- Rawalpindi → read `rawalpindi/`
- Moawin or Akhuwat → read `moawin-akhuwat/` (use `organization_id` to split within region)

If the region's rules don't exist yet, tell the user: "Rules for [region] haven't been added yet."

## General Rules (all regions, always active)
- `data-governance.md` — metric access, audit, classification
- `bigquery.md` — partition-first policy, cost control, event table rules
- `caching.md` — freshness, invalidation, loop prevention
- `failure-handling.md` — retries, circuit breaker, dead letter queue
- `observability.md` — 3-layer telemetry, audit log, structured logging
- `versioning.md` — **ALWAYS bump version before push**, patch vs minor rules

## Cross-Region KPI Comparability

Cross-region comparison is limited to **volume and coverage metrics**. Qualitative comparison (scores, outcomes) is NOT valid because regions use fundamentally different tools and scoring frameworks.

| KPI | ICT Source | RWP Source | Moawin/Akhuwat Source | Comparable Metric |
|-----|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| User data | user_school_profiles | TaleemHub_DB.users | Muawin_Akhuwat_db.teachers | Teacher count, cohort size |
| Lesson plans | analytics_events (canonical) | RUMI_DB.lesson_plans | Zavia_db.lesson_plans | Volume only |
| Coaching - Human | coaching_observation (scored) | mentoring_visits (narrative) | N/A | Session count + coverage % |
| Coaching - AI | observation stack (automated) | coaching_sessions | Zavia_db.coaching_sessions | Session count + completion rate |
| Student results - AI | not active | reading_assessments | Zavia_db.reading_assessments | Not comparable yet |
| Student results - Human | ODK ASER | TaleemHub ASER | Muawin_Akhuwat_db.student_scores | Volume only |
| Training | teacher_training_level | Not in scope | Muawin_Akhuwat_db.teacher_training_progress | Module/quiz completion |
| Attendance | Not in scope | Not in scope | Muawin_Akhuwat_db.teacher_attendances | Moawin/Akhuwat only |

## Database Context
- **BigQuery:** Project `niete-bq-prod` — `tbproddb` (466 tables, ICT), `RUMI_DB` (70 tables, RWP AI), `TaleemHub_DB` (60 tables, RWP roster), `Muawin_Akhuwat_db` (~50 tables, Schoolpilot), `Zavia_db` (~57 tables, Zavia AI)
- **PostgreSQL (Rawalpindi only):** `neondb` (Schoolpilot) and `zavia1` (Zavia) — still PostgreSQL for RWP
- More datasets will be added after migration from other sources
